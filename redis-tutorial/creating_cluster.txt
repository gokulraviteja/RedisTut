Go to this Folder

redis-6.0.1⁩ ▸ ⁨utils⁩ ▸ ⁨create-cluster⁩ 


#By default starts 5 nodes with ports 30001,30002...

#Start a cluster
./⁨create-cluster⁩ start
./⁨create-cluster⁩ create


#To stop the cluster
./⁨create-cluster⁩ stop


Ran into Error : See EOF.


Manually

#create a folder 
mkdir cluster-test 
cd cluster-test

#create n folders for n nodes
mkdir 7000 7001 7002 7003 7004 7005

#make a config file in every folder 
cd 7000
nano redis.conf

#config file looks like (port number varies accordingly)
port 7000
cluster-enabled yes
cluster-config-file nodes.conf
cluster-node-timeout 5000
appendonly yes

#for each folder in a new terminal tab
cd 7000
redis-server ./redis.conf

cd 7001
redis-server ./redis.conf

...



I did face this error :
	using create-cluster BIN_PATH is set as ../../src
	if that directory is not present , change it accordingly where redis-server is present else just remove the $BIN_PATH in all three while loops of create , stop, start.

Other :
	Reach me .
